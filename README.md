# card-game

  A card matching game built using react, redux, mongodb, webpack and Nodejs(ofcourse). 
  All the cards have numbers hidden inside them. In one draw you have to click on two cards to flip them and reveal their number. If the numbers match, then they are removed from the list. You have to match all the cards in this manner. Once all the cards are matched, the game is finished and the time of completion is noted. 
  
  This game is all about being fast(not furious). So head on to this [link](https://card-game-memory.herokuapp.com) and give it a try.
